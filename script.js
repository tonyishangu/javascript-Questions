// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
// and height in meter).



// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.


// Test data:
// § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
// m tall.
// § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
// m tall.
// GOOD LUCK �

//  Coding Challenge #2


// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
// improve it.
// Your tasks:

// 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
// is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
// BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
// Hint: Use an if/else statement �

 //variable
 let markweight = 78
 let johnweight = 92
 let markHeight = 1.69
 let johnHeight = 1.95
 
 //bmi
 let markBmi = markweight / (markHeight * markHeight)
 let johnBmi = johnweight / (johnHeight * johnHeight)
 
 //compare
 if(markBmi > johnBmi){
     console.log('mark has a higher bmi');
 } else {
     console.log('john has a higher bmi');
 }


//  Coding Challenge #3

// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each 
// other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, 
// and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that 
// as well (draw means they have the same average score)
// 3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a 
// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a 
// score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum 
// score, as well as multiple else-if blocks �
// 4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when 
// both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 
// points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy

// Test data:
// § Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// § Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
// § Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106
// GOOD LUCK 

const dolphinsScore = [96, 108, 89]
const kualasScore = [88, 91, 110]
//calc average
let dolphinsAvg = Math.floor((96 + 108 + 89) /3)
let kualasAvg = Math.floor((88 + 91 + 110) / 3)
// console.log(dolphinsAvg);
//compare winner
if(dolphinsAvg > kualasAvg && dolphinsAvg >= 100){
    console.log('dolphins winners');
} else if(dolphinsAvg === kualasAvg && dolphinsAvg >= 100 && kualasAvg >= 100 ) {
    console.log('its a draw');

// Coding Challenge #4

// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a 
// restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 
// 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for 
// this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement � (If it's easier for you, you can 
// start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary 
// operator!)
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value 
// (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 
// 316.25”

// Test data:
// § Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
// Hints:
// § To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
// § Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 �
// GOOD LUCK 
let bill = 275
// let tip = 0
const tip = bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2
const billPaid = bill + tip
console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total is ${billPaid}`);
